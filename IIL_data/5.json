      "Low air flow across the evaporator coil",
      "Faulty expansion valve",
      "Incorrect superheat or subcooling values"
    ],
    "Role": "Evaporator Saturation Temperature is an important parameter that helps to determine the cooling capacity of the chiller. If the temperature is not within the specified range, it can cause a drop in cooling capacity and inefficient operation of the chiller.",
    "Root Causes": [
      "Low refrigerant charge",
      "Dirty or clogged evaporator coil",
      "Faulty expansion valve",
      "Incorrect superheat or subcooling values"
    ],
    "Recommendations for Solution": [
      "Charge the refrigerant to the specified level",
      "Clean the evaporator coil",
      "Replace the expansion valve if faulty",
      "Adjust the superheat or subcooling values to the specified range"
    ],
    "Preventive Actions": [
      "Regularly check the refrigerant charge level",
      "Clean the evaporator coil at regular intervals",
      "Maintain proper air flow across the evaporator coil",
      "Periodically check the expansion valve for proper operation",
      "Monitor the superheat and subcooling values"
    ],
    "Corrective Actions": [
      "Charge the refrigerant to the specified level",
      "Clean the evaporator coil",
